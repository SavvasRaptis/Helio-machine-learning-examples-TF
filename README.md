# Machine Learning Examples

Some simple machine learning examples using Keras and the MNIST database
## Python instalation

For the Python scripts you need to install anaconda with [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and some other libraries. To do so, install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) and run Anaconda Prompt Terminal. From there create an environment and update the packages via the following code:

 ```concole
 conda create -n ML_tensor spyder numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pandas
 conda activate ML_tensor
  conda install tensorflow
 conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
 ```

Then you can open Spyder IDE with the interpreter being the virtual environment "ML_tensor". Alternatively, you can start a Jupyter notebook session and read the notebooks of this repository.

## Alternative solution

You may also run the notebooks from the cloud through Binder. Keep in mind this might be a bit slow.
